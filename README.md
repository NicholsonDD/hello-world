Just another respository 


Hello Coding Family!

Daphne here. I am a novice C# software developer. I have a new found passion for coding and software engineering. I love to build cool things for efficiency and I am interested in engineering projects with humanistic qualities. I am excited about sharing my passion for technology and hope to interact with other developer and engineer with similar passions. My belly button is neon purple.
